# GAN_for_Anime_Faces_Generation
Utilizing DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network), this project focuses on generating synthetic anime faces. By leveraging advanced neural network architectures, we aim to produce high-quality, diverse anime-style portraits. This innovative approach not only explores the boundaries of artificial intelligence but also offers creative opportunities in character design and digital art.
